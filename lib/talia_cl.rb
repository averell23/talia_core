# This is the loader file for the Talia command line tool.
# 
# The Talia command line works as follows: This file will load some helper
# methods that can be used to register subcommands for the command line tool.
#
# Each subcommand is registered with a name (as symbol), a description string
# and a block that will be run if the command is selected.
#
# If the command line processing is started, the first command line argument 
# will be taken as the name of the command to be run. The argument will be
# removed from ARGV, and then the block belonging to the command will be 
# executed.
