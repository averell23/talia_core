module TaliaCore
  module DataTypes
    
    # Class to manage IIP Image data type. This differs from the "normal" 
    # file record in various ways:
    #
    # * The record itself only contains a thumbnail version of the image as 
    #   data (#get_thumbnail will return the file data for the thumbnail)
    # * The location of the record contains the path to the image on the
    #   IIP server. This is also returned by #iip_server_path
    # * The records should be created using the IipLoader - see DataLoader
    #   to find out how to configure Talia to do that
    #
    # = What is IIP?
    #
    # IIP is a protocol to use "pyramidal images" - which are images which
    # contain a tiled version of the original image in various resolutions.
    # It is used to serve high-resolution images in a way that a client can 
    # request only the portion of the image that is currently needed.
    #
    # = How does IIP work with Talia?
    #
    # To use IIP, an IIP server is needed.
    # The IIP client will connect to the server and request an image from using
    # HTTP requests. 
    #
    # The IIP server is a separate piece of sofware, which is not part of
    # Talia. The one commonly used is http://iipimage.sourceforge.net/ which
    # runs as a fastcgi module in Apache (or another web server).
    #
    # For talia this means:
    #
    # * The pyramidal images have to be put in a place where the IIP server can
    #   access them - they do *not* go in the normal data directory.
    # * The location of the directory for the pyramidal images can be configured
    #   as <tt>iip_root_directory_location</tt> in the <tt>talia_core.yml</tt>
    #   file.
    # * The <tt>location</tt> field of each IipData record contains the _relative_
    #   path for accessing the file on the IIP server.
    # * The URI of the server itself can be set in <tt>talia_core.yml</tt> as
    #   <tt>iip_server_uri</tt>
    #
    # = How can the IIP images be shown in Talia?
    #
    # There are several clients or "viewers" for IIP images available, and one
    # is also included in the "muruca_widgets" gem that can be installed in
    # addition to talia.
    #
    # Generally you'll have to include the client in your view templates, and
    # use the #iip_server_uri and #iip_server_path to point it to the image
    # on the server.
    #
    # Obviously you'll also need a running IIP server.
    #
    # = What are the requirements for IIP?
    #
    # Apart from the IIP server itself, you'll need some software to actually
    # create the pyramidal images - see the TaliaUtil::ImageConversions class for details.
    class IipData < FileRecord
      
      # Returns the IIP server configured for the application. This is usually the
      # value configured as the <tt>iip_server_uri</tt> in the <tt>talia_core.yml</tt>
