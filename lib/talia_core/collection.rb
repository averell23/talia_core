module TaliaCore

  # Represents a collection of sources. In addition to being a container for 
  # sources, the Collection class will also provide an ordering of the contained
  # sources. 
  #
  # In a nutshell, this behaves like an array of sources that preserves
  # the order when saved.
  # 
  # The ordering will always assign a ''unique'' integer value to each contained
  # source that defines its position in the order of elements. The collection will
  # keep an internal array where each object's index maps directly to its position 
  # in the collection; the array and ordering are saved to the data store when
  # the collection itself is saved.
  #
  # The collection class is relatively lightweight and will behave mostly like
  # the underlying array - most operations are simply passed through to the array and
  # nothing is saved before the collection itself is saved.
  #
  # Operations that are passed to the underlying array are: +, <<, ==, []=, at, clear,
  # collect, delete_at, delete, each, each_index, empty?, include?, index, join, 
  # last, length and size.
  #
  # This also means that all checks on added objects will only be performed when
  # the collection is saved, and not much checking is done when the array is
  # modified.
  #
  # Important: it is required that no object in the list be present more than once.
  #
  # In the RDF, the collection is represented as a seqContainer, using a predicate of
  # "http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#_[index of element x]" to connect an
  # element x with the collection.
  #
  # *Note*: This class replaces the previous OrderedSource class
