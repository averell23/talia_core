module TaliaCore

  # Represents a collection of sources. In addition to being a container for 
  # sources, the Collection class will also provide an ordering of the contained
  # soruces.
  # 
  # The ordering will always assign a ''unique'' integer value to each contained
  # source, that define it's position in the order of elements. (The collection will
  # keep an internal array where each object's index maps directly to its position 
  # in the collection).
  #
  # The collection class is relatively lightweight and will behave mostly like
  # the underlying array.
  #
  # This also means that all checks on added objects will only be performed when
  # the collection is saved, and not much checking is done when the array is
  # modified.
  #
  # '''Note''': This class replaces the previous OrderedSource class
  # 
  # The collection is contained in the ordered_objects - if you ever use that
  # accessor all "ordering" relations for the object will be completely overwritten
  # on saving. (You can still assign the predicates manually as long as the
  # ordered_objects accesssor is not called before saving.)
