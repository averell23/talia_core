  # This class provides an ordering on the related sources. It will load the
  # related elements into an array. All changes made to the OrderedSource will
  # reflect on the Array, and will only be persisted to the store on save.
  #
  # The collection is contained in the ordered_objects - if you ever use that
  # accessor all "ordering" relations for the object will be completely overwritten
  # on saving. (You can still assign the predicates manually as long as the
  # ordered_objects accesssor is not called before saving.)
