= TaliaCore

This is the "core" of the Talia semantic digital web library system. Talia can
be used with Ruby on Rails, or as a standalone package.

More documentation can be found on the Talia website: 
http:///trac.talia.discovery-project.eu/

= Installation

If you have the Talia files on your sytem, you're almost there. For now,
please consult the web page for installation instructions.

= Configuration

When you're in Rails, you can start Talia in the environment.rb, using the
TaliaCore::Initializer - if you're building a standalone application, it's
almost the same (although you'll have to use standalone_db=yes to configure
ActiveRecord manually)

There are some sample configuration files in the distribution:

* talia_core.yml - This file contains the main configuration. 
* database.yml - Standalon Db configuration. Same format as for Rails.
* rdfstore.yml - RDF storage configuration.

The default configuration (talia_core.yml) will use the database.yml and
rdfstore.yml to configure the data storage. See the example filme for an
explanation of the options. The database configuration will only be used if
you are running Talia standalone; otherwise you must use RAILS' existing
database connection.

The options for the RDF store vary depending on the store that you have selected,
but some examples are provideed.
