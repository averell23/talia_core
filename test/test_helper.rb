    # Helper to create a variable only once. This should be used from the
    # setup method, and will assign the given block to the given class variable.
    # 
    # The block will only be executed once, after that the value for the
    # class variable will be retrieved from a cache. 
    #
    # This is a workaround because the Ruby test framework doesn't provide 
    # a setup_once method or something like this, and in fact re-creates the
    # Test case object for every single test (go figure). It would be 
    # worth switching to RSpec just for this, but it's a heap of work so... the
    # test framework has just the braindead "fixtures" mechanism...
    #
    # The thing is that's a good practice to have reasonably fine-grained tests,
    # and you often have objects that are re-used often, are read-only for all
    # the tests and expensive to create. So you basically want to create them
    # only once.
    #
    # This thing is less than perfect, but it should work for now. Basically it
    # assumes that all tests for a TestCase will be run in a row, and the
    # setup method will execute before the first test and that no other tests
    # will execute before all tests of the TestCase are executed.
